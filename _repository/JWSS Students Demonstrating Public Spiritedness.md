<p>On 13 August 2021, Lee Ru Ting (3E3) and Misha Jing Er Misra (3E2) were on their way home after school, when they caught sight of a Central Refuse Chute catching fire at Block 663B.</p>
  
<p>Without hesitation, Ru Ting and Misha decided to call 995 for help. The fire was eventually put out promptly without causing much damage to the surrounding buildings. For their civic-mindedness, quick thinking and fast reaction, Ru Ting and Misha had probably prevented further endangerment to the public due to the fire.</p>Â
