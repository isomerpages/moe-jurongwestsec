## An Exciting Opportunity

  
An Exciting Programme Awaits JWSS students with effect from the year 2018!   
  
As a first for the school, JWSS has partnered Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) for the HCI Boarding School Experience. This very unique programme offers JWSS students a rare opportunity to experience the HCI Boarding which aims to promote a culture of camaraderie, unity and friendship among boarders of different cultural backgrounds. Activities and events in the boarding become a platform for boarders to showcase their abilities and talents and a path for them to discover and explore their other potentials.
