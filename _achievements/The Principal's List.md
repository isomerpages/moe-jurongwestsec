The Principal’s List, the most coveted academic award in the school, was introduced in 2015 to both recognise and commend students from the Secondary 1–5 levels in the Express, Normal Academic (NA) and Normal Technical (NT) courses for their consistent and outstanding academic performance in the Examinations.

At each semestral examinations (Mid-Year and End of Year), students who achieve outstanding results would be placed on the Principal’s List and be awarded a Certificate of Commendation by the school. In addition to motivating the students, it is our hope that students on the Principal’s List would also be an inspiration to the student body that with the discipline to pursue their dreams, hard work and effort, nothing is impossible.
