With our students returning to school progressively from this week, it will be another period of readjustment for you and your children. As we continue with our Safe Management Measures in school, how can we support them to adopt and settle in this new normal while taking care of our own well-being?

The PSG Online Guide - “Parent Support Groups – A How-to Guide By Parents For Parents” – is a resource that provides useful tips and guidelines in setting up and sustaining good PSGs.  It was initiated and developed by 5 PSG leaders from 9th COMPASS (Community and Parents in Support of School) Council with the support of several PSG leaders.  

The Guide was launched on 4 February 2017 by Assoc. Prof Dr. Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Parliamentary Secretary for Ministry of Education and Ministry of Social and Family Development at the 2017 School-Home Partnership Networking session at Maris Stella High School (Secondary). Over 400 Parent Support Group (PSG) Leaders and school staff were engaged in rich discussions on how to reach out to parents for better educational and learning outcomes for our children.

Instilling positive values in our children begins at home and our schools reinforce it through daily activities and Character and Citizenship Education in schools. As parents, how can you do your part to raise your children with values like empathy, respect and compassion for others? Take some time to try any of the 4 tips to nurture your child to be a compassionate person. Click [here](https://www.schoolbag.sg/story/raising-a-compassionate-child) to find out more about the tips.  You can also begin this conversation with your child using a series of videos MOE has produced on Learning Values. The series of 6 videos uses simple and everyday scenarios to depict the different values a child should learn – Care, Responsibility, Integrity, Respect, Resilience and Harmony. Parents can use these [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glTlcwXNrXU&index=6&list=PLgBw4fHUtzK0DQOmXWII2xujOVgBZ6n2t) to engage your child and educate them on the importance of these positive values.
