<h3>JW Teaching &amp; Learning Framework</h3>
<p>Our teaching and learning framework is grounded in three core principles
from <em>How People Learn</em>: <strong>Activate Prior Knowledge</strong>, <strong>Build Conceptual Understanding</strong>,
and <strong>Develop Metacognition and Reflection</strong>. These principles
guide our approach to fostering deep and meaningful learning, enabling
students to connect new knowledge to existing understanding, organise ideas
coherently, and reflect on their thinking processes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These principles are reinforced through the <strong>teaching processes </strong>outlined
in the Singapore Teaching Practice framework: <strong>assessment and feedback</strong>, <strong>positive classroom culture</strong>, <strong>lesson preparation</strong>,
and <strong>lesson enactment</strong>. These practices ensure that learning
is purposeful, inclusive, and dynamic, creating an environment where both
teachers and students thrive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Together, these elements aim to nurture studentsâ€™ <strong>future-ready</strong> in
four key domains outline in our <strong>JWSS Key-Shaped competencies</strong>:</p>
