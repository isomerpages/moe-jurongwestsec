<h2>Activities for 2023</h2>
<p><strong>10 March 2023: Annual Sports Day 2023</strong>
</p>
<p>The eagerly awaited JWSS Annual Sports Day made its triumphant return
at the Bukit Gombak Stadium this year, casting a sense of excitement and
anticipation among the students. This particular event held profound significance
for our Secondary 4 students, as it represented both their inaugural and
farewell Sports Day experience at JWSS, owing to the disruptions caused
by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The event's primary goal was to provide students with an opportunity to
engage in a range of Track &amp; Field events, pushing their personal boundaries
and competing for the coveted Best Class Award. This fostered a vibrant
yet competitive atmosphere at the stadium, with students vying for recognition
and, of course, the ultimate bragging rights.</p>
<p>But beyond the competition, the day celebrated the spirit of sportsmanship
and camaraderie as students engaged in Inter-Class and Inter-CCA races.
It was a chance for them to come together, cheer for their peers, and forge
lasting bonds. Additionally, classes had the opportunity to strengthen
their connections through fun-filled fringe activities, thoughtfully organized
by our dedicated Sports Leaders.</p>
<p>Not to be left out, teachers and members of the Parent Support Group (PSG)
had their share of enjoyment during the Teachers’ Race segment. This event
was a joyful culmination of the term, blending the values of sportsmanship
and camaraderie with the celebration of the school year's conclusion.</p>
