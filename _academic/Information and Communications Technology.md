<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>In the rapidly changing world, the skills to actively participate in the
increasingly digital landscape, and be future ready is vital. The Smart
Nation will call forth a new generation of computational and design thinkers
who possess the problem-solving skills that are applicable in a diverse
range of fields and most fields in the future will have a footing in computing.
Armed with these skills, our students will have a competitive edge.</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>O-Level Computing is an MOE-applied subject&nbsp;offered from 2017</p>

<p>The two-year course at upper secondary level is to enable students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Apply&nbsp;<strong>Computational Thinking</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Design Thinking</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Systems Thinking</strong>&nbsp;Skills
in&nbsp;<strong>analysing&nbsp;problems</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>developing solutions</strong>;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop simple programs</strong>&nbsp;through the use of appropriate
programming language(s);&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand how and where information communications technology (ICT) is
used in daily life;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand and explain the ethical, social and economic issues associated
with the use of ICT.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This syllabus comprises four modules of study to cover five common areas
of computer science concepts and skills.</p>
<p>The four modules are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Module I – Data and Information&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<p>Module III – Abstraction and Algorithms&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Module IV – Programming</p>

<br><strong>Computing Education Framework</strong>&nbsp;<strong>–</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Relationship Diagram</strong>&nbsp;
<br>An important aspect of the Computer Education Framework is the relationship
between the&nbsp;<strong>Core Concepts</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Computational Thinking and Practices</strong>:
Core Concepts and Computational Thinking are applied in the Practices,
and the Practices will in turn deepen one’s understanding of the Core Concepts.</p>

<p>Curriculum</p>
<p>Computer Applications (CPA) is a&nbsp;<strong>compulsory subject</strong>&nbsp;for
all Normal Technical (NT) students. The CPA curriculum spans four years,
from Secondary 1 to Secondary 4, leading to national examinations at the
end of Secondary 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lower secondary syllabus focuses on equipping students with fundamental&nbsp;<strong>ICT skills</strong>&nbsp;that
will&nbsp;<strong>support learning of the other NT subjects</strong>&nbsp;and
are&nbsp;<strong>useful in their personal life</strong>. At the&nbsp;<strong>upper secondary levels</strong>,
the syllabus focuses on&nbsp;<strong>higher-order thinking skills</strong>.
There is attention to&nbsp;<strong>problem solving</strong>&nbsp;and understanding&nbsp;<strong>basic programming concepts and skills</strong>.
Basic programming concepts and skills will be learnt through simple animation
and game design; and eventually, applying them to solve problems in everyday
context. This will better&nbsp;<strong>prepare</strong>&nbsp;<strong>students</strong>&nbsp;for
further studies in&nbsp;<strong>programming and media-related courses</strong>;
as well as for the work place and future learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All students will be exposed to internet technologies and tools that are
readily available e.g. using collaborative tools from Google Apps.&nbsp;<strong>Hands-on activities</strong>&nbsp;continue
to be the main feature of this&nbsp;<strong>skill-based subject</strong>.
Tasks that require an integrated use of&nbsp;<strong>office software applications</strong>&nbsp;and
problem sets that step the learner through the learning process will feature
prominently in the course of learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will have opportunities to do&nbsp;<strong>creative work</strong>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>animation</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>game development</strong>&nbsp;projects
that will be part of the curriculum in&nbsp;<strong>Secondary 2</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Secondary 3</strong>,
respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Animation and Game Making Competition 2020</h4>
<p>The Animation and Game Making (Previously known as Media Computing (MEC))
Competition is an annual competition for Secondary students offering Computer
Applications. It is organised by the Computer Education Unit, Curriculum
Planning and Development Division. The objectives of the AGM Competition
are to provide a platform to showcase students’ work, develop students’
interest in media design; and hone students’ communication and presentation
skills.</p>
<p>Students are to create a game based on the theme, Adventure. We are proud
to announce that Tan Li Chuan, 3T1 is awarded the Bronze Award for the
Animation and Game Making Competition – Game Category.</p>

<h4>NTU School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) Python Workshop</h4>
<p>The Python Programming Workshop for the Youth was organised by NTU Computer
Science and Engineering Club, in partnership with Jurong West Secondary
School. The program aimed at providing students from Jurong West Secondary
School an exposure to modern computational thinking and cultivate their
interest in Information Technology as well as providing opportunities for
SCSE students to participate in community events. The students participated
actively and benefited from the five weeks of training, which culminated
in a competition and presentation.</p>
