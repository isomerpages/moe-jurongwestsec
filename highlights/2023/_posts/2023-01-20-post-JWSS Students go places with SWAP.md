SWAP @ JWSS - Sentosa Development Corporation
------
After a 2 year hiatus due to Covid-19 restrictions, SWAP @ JWSS has made a comeback and with new organisations onboard!   
  
In December 2022, 2 students from JWSS, Kok Sheung Leng (3E1) and Keneshaarai  D/O Perumal (Shasha, 3E4), went on a Student Work Attachment Programme (SWAP) with Sentosa Development Corporation. During the attachment, they learnt more about the hospitality industry as well as gained first hand experience in handling visitors to Sentosa!  
  
Sheung Leng and Shasha were also featured in Sentosa Development Corporation's Instagram and Linkedin Accounts.   
  
Below are some screengrabs from Sentosa Development Corporation's Instagram post.
