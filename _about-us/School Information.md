<h3>Brief History</h3>
<p>Jurong West Secondary School (JWSS) was established on 2 January 2001
and operated along Jalan Boon Lay. On 18 March 2002, the school moved to
the current 3.1-hectare premises, which boast facilities such as computer
and science laboratories and special rooms for Art, Music and Dance.&nbsp;The
sports facilities included an astro-turf for hockey, an indoor sports hall
commissioned in 2009 and an artificial turf for the school field. Further
infrastructural enhancements from 2015-2019, saw the addition of The Book
Room, The Learning Hive, The Loft and other learning spaces to nurture
the joy of learning and enhance student well-being.</p>
<p>In its early years, the school achieved numerous awards including Sustained
Achievement awards (Physical Fitness, Sports, Aesthetics, Uniformed Groups),
National Education Development Award, Character Development Award and Business
Excellence Award (People Developer) establishing itself as a school that
delivers holistic education. The school was recognised as a Niche School
in Uniformed Groups in 2007. In 2014, the school was selected to be one
of the 12 prototype schools for Subject-Based Banding and in 2017, was
selected to offer the Enhanced Art Programme (EAP).</p>
<p>Over the years, the school has established itself as a choice school with
several distinctive programme offerings - its unique Applied Learning Programme
(ALP), Learning for Life Programme (LLP) and subjects such as Computing
and Exercise and Sports Science. 2016 saw the launch of&nbsp;<strong>JeWel</strong>,
the school’s talent development in English, Mathematics, Science, Art and
Sports. Opportunities via programmes such as Student Work Attachment, Attachment
to Member of Parliament and Overseas Student Exchange in China and Japan
saw the school featured in The Straits Times in November 2016 for its distinctive
programmes that make the school an attractive choice for students.</p>
<p>In 2022, as a response to the changing global and national landscape,
the school underwent re-envisioning, and set the trajectory for the school
to focus on nurturing Future Ready Learners, Thinkers and Leaders with
a refreshed school vision -&nbsp;<strong><em>Learners, Thinkers, Leaders of Tomorrow</em></strong>.
Guided by this vision, the school strengthened the&nbsp;<em>JW Experience</em>&nbsp;for
students-&nbsp;<em>an experience</em>&nbsp;which enables students to achieve
Academic Excellence with guidance, care and support,&nbsp;<em>an experience</em>&nbsp;which
provides students with a wide variety of opportunities in Singapore and
overseas to discover, develop and excel holistically and&nbsp;<em>an experience</em>&nbsp;which
nurtures in them desired values and enduring skillsets in a positive and
conducive school environment.</p>

</p>
<p>The eagle represents strength of character with outspread wings looking
west, guarding the virtues of the school embodied within the school crest.
The contoured shape and design of the crest is reminiscent of the badges
of the guardians of the civilian society signifying discipline. Above its
head and outspread wings, the initials of the school take position and
precedence.</p>
<p>The school's virtues are symbolised by the four designs in the two halves
of the crest.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two clasped hands form the shape of a heart symbolising the school's aspiration
to create individuals who will serve the needs of the community as a leader.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The atomic symbol represents the need to be technologically oriented as
mankind explores the realms of the digital age and cyber space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An unconventional square bulb symbolises inventive and adaptive thinking
to help nurture creative and innovative minds.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A flaming torch representing the passion for lifelong learning is placed
over a scroll signifying academic excellence, the former taking precedence
over the latter.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, displayed at the base of the crest, is the school motto reinforcing
the courage of the eagle.</p>
