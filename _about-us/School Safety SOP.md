A safe and secure environment where teaching and learning takes place.

**JWSS School Safety Mission**

To support schools in developing a safety culture where all staff exercise care and vigilance in the planning and conduct of all lessons and school activities.

**JWSS School Safety Policy**

We ensure that the school is a safe and secure place where all staff exercise care and vigilance in the planning and conduct of lessons and school activities. All members of the school community are also alert to safety considerations at all times.

**JWSS School Safety Guiding Principles**

To have a School Safety Committee headed by School Leaders to ensure the safety of staff and students.

To adopt reasonably practicable measures to prevent all foreseeable incidents in schools.

To take a whole-school approach to ensure every individual takes personal responsibility for her/his own safety and to look out for the safety of others.

To build staff capacity in safety-related competencies.

**SCHOOL TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT PLAN**

**Objectives**

To work with students and stakeholders (e,g, parents and the community) on correct road safety behavior to be observed by all.

To provide road safety education as part of the school’s effort in ensuring the safety of students.

To ensure every effort is made to communicate the school’s road safety rules to parents and stakeholders.

  

**Concept**

As part of ensuring the safety of school staff and students in school, JWSS consistently applies and reviews the traffic management plan on its premises.&nbsp; The plan is developed according to the following principles:

Road safety is everyone’s responsibility. The school will partner stakeholders (e.g. parents and the community) and educate students to develop road safety practices within and around school.

Road safety rules and practices are regularly communicated to students and stakeholders to inculcate sound road safety practices.

Regular and timely review of traffic management plan will ensure the effectiveness and validity of road safety processes for students and stakeholders within and around school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
