<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>We believe that every Student Ambassador can contribute as a community
youth leader beyond the school. Fuelled by passion and centred on values,
Student Ambassadors influence their peers through advocating social and
sustainability causes. Through the various initiatives and programmes,
Student Ambassadors grow as leaders and exercise thought leadership for
the emerging green economy and care economy of tomorrow.</p>
<h1>Vision</h1>
<p>See a Need, Take the Lead</p>
<h1>Leadership Training</h1>
<p>Student Ambassadors will receive training in the Leadership Challenge
(Kouzes and Posner) 5 practices and 10 commitments, namely:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Model the Way</p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Challenge the Process</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enabling Others to Act</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspire a Shared Vision</p>
<p>In addition, Student Ambassadors receive specialized training in Sustainability
Education through learning journeys, external partnerships and sharing
