<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>We believe that every Student Ambassador can contribute as a community
youth leader beyond the school. Fuelled by passion and centred on values,
Student Ambassadors influence their peers through advocating social and
sustainability causes. Through the various initiatives and programmes,
Student Ambassadors grow as leaders and exercise thought leadership for
the emerging green economy and care economy of tomorrow.</p>
