Overview
--------

  
At the apex of Student Leadership in JWSS, our Student Councillors (SCs) represent the student population and serve as the vital link between the students and the school management for the continuous improvement of&nbsp;**student welfare**,&nbsp;**school programmes**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**infrastructure**.

Vision
------

**Dare**&nbsp;to&nbsp;**LEAD**,&nbsp;**SERVE**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**INSPIRE**  

Emblem
------

  
![image 2.jpg](/images/image 2.jpg)  
The&nbsp;**olive branch**&nbsp;represents the SCs as caring leaders who are humble and willing to serve the school.  
  
The&nbsp;**gryphon**, a traditional symbol of leadership for centuries, is a mythical creature that possesses an eagle’s agility and speed combined with a lion’s strength and courage. It reflects our SCs’ confidence and competency in embodying leadership.  
  
The&nbsp;**five stars**&nbsp;represent our school values – respect, resilience, integrity, care and excellence.  

Leadership Framework
--------------------

  
At the end of their 4 years of leadership journey, the SCs will have grown in their capacity to lead others with competence and&nbsp;care,&nbsp;and influence their peers to bring about a positive change to the school and society through meaningful collaborations.

**Student Leaders' Appointment and Student Council Investiture 2022**

  

The Student Leaders’ Appointment and Student Council Investiture Ceremony 2022 was held on 26 May in the school hall, to celebrate the contributions of outgoing CCA student leaders, Student Ambassadors (SA) and Student Councillors (SC) to the school community. In addition, it served as a platform where incoming student leaders were appointed and given due recognition by the school.&nbsp;

The Investiture started with a speech by our school principal, Ms Tan Ming Ming, who spoke about what a leader is and what leadership entails. In particular, she highlighted the importance of both “Personal Leadership” and “Positional Leadership”. Next, the incoming student leaders showcased their CCA groups through various presentations, while the outgoing CCA student leaders, SA and SC presented symbolic items to their respective successors to represent the handover of the leadership reins. The newly appointed student leaders then took the Student Leaders’ Pledge and committed themselves to continuing the long tradition of exemplary student leadership demonstrated by their predecessors. The Investiture concluded with a speech by the 22nd Student Council President Randilyn Liau from 3E2, who wished all incoming student leaders a wonderful learning journey ahead as they continue their transformation into leaders who aspire to serve and inspire the school community to the best of their abilities.
