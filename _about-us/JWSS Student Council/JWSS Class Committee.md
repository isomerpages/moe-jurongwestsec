Selection Process
-----------------

An aspiring JWSS Student Leader should possess the qualities of confidence, care and competence.&nbsp;

![02.png](https://jurongwestsec.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u198/Character%20Development/Student%20Leadership/JWSS%20Class%20Committee/2022/02.png)

Table A shows the behavioral indicators used as a reference for the respective qualities.

  

Both teachers and students will have the opportunity to observe and look out for students who possess these qualities in the first three weeks of school. Students will then be given the autonomy to nominate peers who they believe will be suitable for the respective positions. They are required to provide an example on the qualities of the student that they have nominated for to justify their nomination.&nbsp;

Class Committee nomination form&nbsp;

  

A class committee nomination form is provided to all students to nominate their peers. Every student has a voice and choice, and thus put in their nominations.

Form Teacher nomination form

  

Form Teachers (FTs) will observe potential class committee members based on student nominations over two weeks. They (FTs) will then nominate their choice of class committee members using the Form Teacher nomination form by indicating the behavioral traits observed.

  

Once the nomination is finalized, an in-class appointment ceremony is conducted in term 1 week 7. The newly appointed members will receive their collar pins and will assume their respective responsibilities from then forth.&nbsp;

**26 August 2022: Class Committee Workshop II  
**  

Class Committee Workshop II was held for Secondary One to Three Class Committee Members on 26 August 2022. This is an annual workshop that is completely led by student leaders. The workshop was aimed at gathering class committee members from different classes to get to know each other and to tap on each other’s experiences so as to empower the members to know what they can do when faced with difficult situations. It also provided an opportunity for the students to get to know fellow class committee members across different levels that play the same role as themselves.

  

The workshop served as a platform for a dedicated group of class committee member volunteers from secondary 3 to sharpen their student leadership competencies through the organising and executing of this workshop.

  

It was helmed by 11 secondary three volunteers:&nbsp;**Gurupreeth Purandara (3E1), Delfia Iryani (3E2), Rohini Terence (3E2), Megan Lee (3E2), Harshini Kailasam (3N1), Ho Zhen Bao (3N1), Krishmita Singh (3N1), Yu Pei Wen (3N1), Ethan Lau (3N1), Marsya Iman (3N1) and Michael Raj Ronibrite (3T1)**. The volunteers planned and facilitated the execution of three segments in which are the ice-breakers, case studies discussions as well as dialogue sessions.

  

Overall, it was no easy feat as it was being conducted face to face again after two years of conducting it on zoom but our student volunteers rose to the occasion to organise a fun and meaningful workshop for the 109 student leaders.

The secondary 3 facilitators started the workshop with ice-breaker games.

At the end of both games, the class committee members reflected as to what they have learnt. A student wrote “it is much easier to have one strong leadership to guide the blind man than a dozen shouting voices. In the absence of good communication, naught can be done.”

**26 August 2021: Class Committee Workshop II**

  

Class Committee Workshop II was held for Secondary One to Three Class Committee Members on 26 August 2021. The workshop was aimed at gathering class committee members from different classes to get to know each other and to tap on each other’s experiences so as to empower the members to know what they can do when faced with difficult situations. It also provided an opportunity for the students to appreciate members of their own class committee after having worked together for almost an entire academic year.

  

The workshop also provided an opportunity for a small group of class committee member volunteers from secondary 3 to sharpen their student leadership competencies through the organising and executing of this workshop.

  

It was helmed by 10 Secondary Three volunteers.&nbsp;**Harshini Mohan (3E1), Vijayakumar Shrinithi (3E1), Nathan Kuwardoyo (3E2), Abdul Qadir (3E2), Chloe Teh Shiying (3E2), Christine Koes (3E2), Gisele Low (3E4), Tan Wei Jie (3N1), Ch ng Kai Wen (3N1) and Elyse Tan Sitong (3T1)**. The volunteers planned and facilitated the execution of 3 segments in mixed-group breakout rooms. The three segments included: ice-breakers, case studies discussions as well as appreciation. &nbsp;

  

All in all, it was no easy feat but our student volunteers rose to the occasion to organise a fun and meaningful workshop of sharing and equipping for the 125 student leaders.

**The theme for the workshop originated from a quote by James Posner, and aimed to remind the Class Committee members that regardless of their predispositions, they could still be an exemplary leader by doing their best!**

**18 and 19 March 2019 : Youth Leaders Camp @ NP**

  

This year, our Class Committee Leaders had an opportunity to attend the 2-day Youth Leaders Camp organised by Ngee Ann Polytechnic from 14 to 15 March 2018. This leadership camp provided a platform for our students to collaborate with others while developing their own leadership skills.

  

The activities offered allowed our Class Committee leaders to discover more about their own leadership profiles, learn how to effectively organise an event such as a VIA project, and be trained in conflict resolution. Our students enjoyed themselves as they managed to foster new friendships in and out of school during the camp.

**27 August 2019: Class Committee Workshop**  
  

Some of the Secondary 3 members who had gone for the Youth Leaders Camp were able to put what they had learnt about organising events into practice when they were tasked to organise a workshop for their fellow class committee members.&nbsp;

  

These members facilitated groups of Class Committee members to play bonding games, learn about the Conflict Resolution framework and practice using the framework through case studies. The workshop ended with surprise affirmation messages from their Form Teachers and it was, all in all, an enjoyable and meaningful one.
