Welcome to Jurong West Secondary School (JWSS)!      
  

This year, our school has made significant strides toward realizing the vision we have set out for our students through the implementation of our strategic plans schoolwide, guided by the belief that our
students must be equipped to thrive in the future as - Learners, Thinkers, and Leaders of Tomorrow. Our vision is for all JWSS students to find joy in learning and strive to reach their fullest potential, becoming
lifelong learners with the adaptive thinking skills needed for a dynamic world. 

We aim to foster confidence, resilience, and leadership, enabling our students to lead themselves first and then inspire others, exercising innovation and continuous improvement along the way.

Our “BlueSky Teams” lead innovations in areas such as STEAM and Sustainability, Developing Key-Shaped Competencies, Student Agency and Leadership, as well as our JWSS Estate and Infrastructure
Upgrade Masterplan, have made significant progress in creating future-ready opportunities to enrich the our students learning. 

Meanwhile, our dedicated staff are engaging in professional development to enhance our teaching pedagogies through Assessment for Learning (AfL) and Metacognitive strategies, which are now
actively applied in classrooms. We are seeing higher levels of student engagement and reflective thinking—a powerful testament to what we can achieve, with even more on the horizon.

I am deeply grateful for the trust and support from our parents and stakeholders, which further fuels our determination to bring our vision to life for our school and students. JWSS is on an exciting journey
of growth, and we invite you to join us in supporting this transformation. Together, let’s continue building a brighter future for our students.
  

In the service of education,  
Ms Tan Ming Ming
