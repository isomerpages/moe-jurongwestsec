                    JWSS is well known in the West for its highly established
                    Uniformed Groups (UGs) – NCC (Land), NPCC, BB and RCY which
                    have been achieving numerous Gold Awards over the last 10
                    years.

                <p>
                    The UGs develop our students’ leadership potential in
                    various ways. Leadership development courses impart to
                    students the basics of leading others. They are regularly
                    given opportunities to take on leadership roles, such as
                    organising camps and events, and purposefully designing
                    activities to help their juniors grow as individuals. The
                    UGs also has a strong culture of mentorship, wherein senior
                    members exercise care and concern for their juniors and
                    nurture them to be leaders of character.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As UG cadets, students will be developed to be confident
                    leaders and inspire others to make a positive impact to the
                    society and the nation.

                    The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in JWSS focusses on
                    equipping students with ICT skills such as coding and app

                    webpage creation as well as communication skills such as
                    persuasive speaking. Students use these knowledge and
