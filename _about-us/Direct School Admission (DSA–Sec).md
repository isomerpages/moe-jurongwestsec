<p>The UGs develop our students’ leadership potential in various ways. Leadership
development courses impart to students the basics of leading others. They
are regularly given opportunities to take on leadership roles, such as
organising camps and events, and purposefully designing activities to help
their juniors grow as individuals. The UGs also have a strong culture of
mentorship, wherein senior members exercise care and concern for their
juniors and nurture them to be leaders of character.</p>
<p>As UG cadets, students will be developed to be confident leaders and inspire
others to make a positive impact to the society and the nation.</p>
