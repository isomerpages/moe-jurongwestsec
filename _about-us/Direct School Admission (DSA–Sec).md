<p>JWSS is well known in the West for its highly established Uniformed Groups
(UGs) – NCC (Land), NPCC, Boys’ Brigade and Red Cross (Youth) which have
been achieving numerous awards over the years. Notably, NPCC and NCC (Land)
have received the Gold/Distinction awards since 2005 and 2006, respectively.
In addition to the annual Gold/Distinction awards, Boys’ Brigade also received
the High Distinction award in 2023.</p>
<p>The UGs develop our students’ leadership potential in various ways. Leadership
development courses impart to students the basics of leading others. They
are regularly given opportunities to take on leadership roles, such as
organising camps and events, and purposefully designing activities to help
their juniors grow as individuals. The UGs also have a strong culture of
mentorship, wherein senior members exercise care and concern for their
juniors and nurture them to be leaders of character.</p>
<p>As UG cadets, students will be developed to be confident leaders and inspire
others to make a positive impact to the society and the nation.</p>
