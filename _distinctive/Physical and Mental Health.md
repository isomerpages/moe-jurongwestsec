<p><strong>Why does health matter?</strong>
</p>
<p>Health is important to everyone as it has an impact on our physical, mental
and social well-being. Maintaining good health helps to keep our bodies
free from illnesses, control our emotions, and improve our social skills.
Hence this would have an impact on our performance in school and work.</p>
<p>The school serves as a platform for students and staff to acquire knowledge,
skills and values that will influence them in future. Hence, the promotion
of health is of utmost importance as it will continue to impact students
and staff even after they leave our school.</p>
