<h3>National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)</h3><p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.</p><h3>Personalised Digital Learning Programme – (PDLP)</h3><p>The use of the Personal Learning Device (PLD) for teaching and learning aims to achieve these MOE intended outcomes of PDLP.&nbsp;</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Intended Outcomes of PDLP.jpg" src="/images/Intended%20Outcomes%20of%20PDLP.jpg"></div><p><br>In JWSS, we aim to achieve these student outcomes through PDLP.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="JWSS Student Outcomes of PDLP.jpg" src="/images/JWSS%20Student%20Outcomes%20of%20PDLP.jpg"></div><p><br>The use of the Personal Learning Device (PLD) in the JWSS classroom allows us to leverage the benefits of both online and face-to-face learning experiences, providing our students with more opportunities to learn at their own pace and to be empowered to take charge of their learning. At the same time, we aim to guide our students to be ethical users of ICT so that they can harness the power of ICT for positive purposes and maintain a positive presence in cyberspace.</p><p>The use of the PLD in the JWSS classroom also complements the three dimensions of lesson delivery based on our JWSS Pedagogy. The following table offers a few examples of how PLDs can enhance teaching and learning in JWSS.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="JWSS Pedagogy and PDLP.jpg" src="/images/JWSS%20Pedagogy%20and%20PDLP.jpg"></div><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Arousing Curiosity</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>PLDs open up new possibilities for our teachers to captivate our students’ attention and imagination by bringing the digital learning environment into our classrooms. For instance, our teachers can employ ICT tools to incorporate a brief presentation by an international authority into the lesson to pique our students’ interests and prime them for learning.</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Facilitating Discovery</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>&nbsp;PLDs transform classroom and CCA interactions between our teachers and our students. With the use of ICT tools, all students can respond simultaneously to the teacher’s questions and can respond to each other’s posts. Such collaborative learning fostered amongst our students can then set them on a journey of exploration and discovery, during which they learn not only through their interactions with the teacher, but also through their online interactions and discussions with one another.</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Enabling Insights</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>PLDs offer our students a digital learning platform beyond the classroom to help them understand how their learning is relevant to their lives. For instance, students’ typed responses on an online discussion can be recorded, revisited, reviewed and reflected upon, long after the lesson has concluded. Our teachers can then extend our students’ learning by linking them to further readings that elaborate on topics of their interest.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Choice of Personal Learning Device (PLD) &amp; Specifications</h2><p></p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/PLD/pld.jpg"></div><p></p><p>** Subject to changes due to availability of device&nbsp;</p><p>The decision to adopt this device was to cater to the needs of the various subjects offered in JWSS. For instance, Applied Learning Programme (ALP) or Computing which requires a notebook and special softwares. At the same time, the device can be transformed into a touch screen tablet and the use of a stylus enables students to ink and draw on the device itself for subjects like Science, Mathematics and more.</p><h3>Responsible Use of the PLD</h3><p>The school will continue to equip students with the relevant knowledge, skills and values to enable a safe and secure learning environment through the&nbsp;<strong>JWSS Cyber Wellness Framework</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The focus of the JWSS CW framework is about helping students to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the benefit of the community.</p><h3>Funding of Device</h3><p>For Singapore Citizen students, after setting aside provision for payment of 2nd tier miscellaneous fees, students can use their available Edusave balance to pay for the PLD.&nbsp; MOE has provided a one-off Edusave top-up of $200 in 2020, to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary students. Please note that it is compulsory for all existing students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted.</p><h3>Financial Assistance</h3><p>To ensure affordability of this device, there will be a one-time Edusave top-up of $200 in your child’s Edusave account. For students who need additional funding support:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Singapore Citizens&nbsp;students whose gross household income (GHI) is $4,000 and below or whose per capita income (PCI) is $1000 and below, can apply for subsidies via the school. Students who are currently on MOE FA and school-based FA need not apply as the subsidies are provided to them automatically.</p></li><li><p>Permanent residents (PR) and international students (IS)&nbsp;should approach the school for more information on financial assistance.</p></li></ul><h3>Device Management Applications (DMA)</h3><p>To support the use of the PLD in the classroom, safeguard students’ cyber safety and develop cyber-wellness, the PLD will be pre-installed with a Device Management Application (DMA). There are 3 Options of DMA for your child/ward's PLD.
