<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>JWSS</strong>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<strong>selected</strong>&nbsp;by
the Ministry of Education to offer the EAP from 1 January 2017. It is currently
one of the&nbsp;<strong>only two schools in the West</strong>&nbsp;offering
the programme.</p>
<p>As the EAP is only offered to students enrolled in the EAP schools, Primary
Six students interested in the EAP at JWSS are advised to include JWSS
among their six choices when selecting their secondary schools.</p>
<p>The EAP was started by MOE HQ in 2011 to provide greater opportunities
for students with a keen disposition and ability in art to develop their
talent.&nbsp; It is a 2-year upper secondary programme that leads to the
GCE O-level Art or Higher Art examination.&nbsp; It provides an enriched
learning environment for students who are passionate about and have talent
in Art.</p>
