<p>In line with the national movement of SkillsFuture where skills mastery
goes beyond having the right paper qualifications and being good at what
you do currently to having a mindset of continually striving towards greater
excellence through knowledge, application as well as experience, in JWSS,
we offer varied opportunities for our students to develop their potential
to the fullest as articulated in our school mission.</p>
<p>One of Jurong West Secondary School's signature programme under Higher
Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is the&nbsp;<strong><em>Student Work Attachment Programme</em></strong>&nbsp;(<strong><em>SWAP</em></strong>).
The&nbsp;<strong><em>SWAP</em></strong>&nbsp;seeks to expose students to
real work environments where they can discover their passion, learn about
specific industries and how the workplace deals with challenges whilst
developing their interpersonal and communication skills.</p>
<p>It is imperative for our students to have a sensing of how the knowledge
and skills they acquire in school is relevant to and can be applied in
the work environment. More specifically, the objectives of this programme
are to enable students to</p>

<p>
<br><strong><em>SWAP</em></strong>&nbsp;is available to our upper secondary
students during the school holidays in the months of June and November
yearly. The length of the attachment is typically from five to ten days,
depending on the industry or organisation.</p>
<p>Students will be informed of the opportunities available with our partners
in the various industries and they can select which company they would
like to be attached to based on their interests and would need to submit
an application and write-up to the school.</p>
<p>Participating organisations and the school work very closely together
to draw up an attachment plan for the student participants, including the
specific areas of work during the attachment and the working hours. A liaison
person or mentor from the organisation together with teachers would take
care of the learning as well as the well-being of our students during the
work attachment period.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the work attachment programme, each student will submit
a reflection about his or her work experience in the organisation to the
school and share their experience with the student body.</p>
<p>Student participants will also be awarded a certificate, jointly signed
by the Principal and a nominated representative from the organisation where
the student was on work attachment.</p>
