# Introduction
  
Cyber Wellness refers to the positive well-being of our students. It involves an understanding of the norms of appropriate, responsible behaviour with regard to technology use as well as knowledge, skills, values and attitudes on how to protect oneself and other internet users in the cyber world. It looks into the positive physical and psychosocial well-being of students in their use of mobile and internet technologies.  

### Goals of Cyber Wellness

The Cyber Wellness curriculum at Jurong West Secondary School aims to advocate for a safer and more considerate online environment for everyone. While promoting proper netiquette among our student, the Cyber Wellness team in JWSS also aims to increase awareness amongst our students on the ill-effects of cyber-bullying and internet addiction. Furthermore, we aim to provide our students with research opportunities through various programmes to inculcate the habit of using the internet in a meaningful way.  

## Key Messages of Cyber Wellness


The key messages to students are to:  

*   Embrace ICT yet maintain a balanced lifestyle between the physical and the cyber world 
*   Harness the power of ICT for positive purposes 
*   Maintain a positive presence in cyberspace  
*   Be a safe and responsible user of ICT
