<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As a future-oriented and forward-looking school which aims to nurture
future ready learners, thinkers and leaders, Jurong West Secondary School
is committed to providing a holistic&nbsp;education for all our students
that allows them to realise their full potential.</p>
<p>The Jurong West (JW) Experience is student-centric where we nurture and
further develop students with special talents and interests through a Talent
Development Programme (TDP), the JeWel Programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enrolment into the programme is based on a student’s talent and passion
as well as academic results in specific subjects.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;photos&gt;</p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>The JeWel Programme&nbsp;emphasises the<strong> interconnectedness</strong> of
the traits of a <strong>Learner, Thinker, and Leader</strong>.</p>
<p>It provides platforms and opportunities for students to develop <strong>future-ready competencies </strong>to <strong>lead themselves and others </strong>whilst
allowing them to <strong>pursue their talent in the respective domains</strong>.</p>
<p>&lt;photos&gt;</p>
<h2>How JeWel Programme Prepares Students for the Future</h2>
<p>The programme is designed to allow students to discover their interest
and further develop their talent, so they are in good stead to pursue their
passion at the upper secondary levels by pursuing relevant ‘O’ Level subjects
such as the Pure Sciences, the Enhanced Art Programme (EAP) or Exercise
and Sports Science (ESS).</p>
<p>Through the programme, students will also be in good stead to pursue their
passion at the post-secondary levels. The&nbsp;JeWel Programme prepares
our young talents well in their chosen areas of interest and gives them
an edge when they enter a Junior College or Polytechnic at the end of Secondary
4 or Secondary 5 as they would have been developing their passion, strength
and portfolio in their years in secondary school.</p>
<h2><strong>For Secondary One Students in JWSS in 2025</strong></h2>
<p>Secondary One students with a&nbsp;<strong>total&nbsp;PSLE AL Score of 14&nbsp;or below</strong> will
be&nbsp;offered <strong>direct admission</strong>&nbsp;into at least one
JeWel Programme. Students who do not meet the above criteria for direct
admission to the TDP based on PSLE results&nbsp;still stand a chance&nbsp;to
be offered entry into the programme based on their performance in the first
year.</p>
<p>So, if you have the passion and talent for English, Mathematics, Science,
Art or Sports, come onboard the&nbsp;JeWel Programme for an exciting journey!&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Programme Overview</h2>
<p>Upon admission into the JeWel Programme, students will be offered out-of-class
enrichment in one of the four domains – <strong>Innovation, Communication, Physical and Aesthetics</strong>.
Supporting the development in these four domains are – English Language,
Mathematics, Science, Aesthetics, Craft and Technology, and Physical Education
departments.</p>
<p>&lt;photos&gt;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The programmes are <strong>inquiry-driven</strong> and <strong>hands-on</strong>,
allowing students to deepen their learning in advanced topics through <strong>customised trainings</strong> and <strong>collaborative group work</strong>.
By working on <strong>authentic tasks</strong> which are situated in <strong>real-world contexts</strong>,
students are encouraged to <strong>draw connections between various disciplines </strong>and
with the real world. Students will also engage in continual reflection,
developing them into <strong>independent learners who are able to chart their own growth</strong>.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All students in the programme are mentored
by teachers who guide them to explore the subjects in greater depth and
prepare them for participation in seminars and competitions. They are also
given the opportunity to learn more about industries relevant to the chosen
domains through learning journeys and expert talks. Students will also
have platforms to engage others in the community and develop greater confidence
and leadership competencies.</p>
