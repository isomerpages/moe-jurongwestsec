In Physical Education &amp; Sports or Art, students nurture their talent further as well as widen their horizons through exposure to a greater variety of sports or art forms during training, events and conferences.&nbsp;</p><p>All students in the programme are mentored by teachers who guide them to explore the subjects in greater depth and prepare them for participation in seminars and competitions. They are also given the opportunities to lead in school, cluster or zonal projects such as the&nbsp;JeWel Challenge organised for the West Zone Primary Schools.&nbsp;</p><p>The programmes are designed to allow students to discover their interest and further develop their talent so they are in good stead to pursue their passion at the upper secondary levels by pursuing relevant ‘O’ Level subjects such as the Pure Sciences, the Enhanced Art Programme (EAP) or Exercise and Sports Science (ESS).</p><p>Through the programme, students will also be in good stead to pursue their passion at the post-secondary levels. The&nbsp;JeWel Programme prepares our young talents well in their chosen areas of interest and gives them an edge when they enter a Junior College or Polytechnic at the end of Secondary 4 or Secondary 5 as they would have been developing their passion and strength in their years in secondary school.&nbsp;</p><h2>Achievements</h2><p>English JeWel </p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Competition</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Achievement</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Year</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>ICAS&nbsp; Assessments 2021</p><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>High Distinction (Top 1% in Singapore)<br>Distinction (Top 10% in Singapore)&nbsp;</p><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2021</p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>The Queens Commonwealth Essay Competition&nbsp;</p><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>1 Gold, 5 Silver, 5 Bronze&nbsp;</p><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2021</p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Voices of the West 2020&nbsp;</p><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>1st and 3rd</p><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2020</p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>3rd YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards</p><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Participation</p><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2019</p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>International Competitions and Assessments for Schools<br>(English Language)</p><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Medal Winner (Highest score in Singapore)&nbsp;<br>High Distinction (Top 1% in Singapore)<br>Distinction (Top 10% in Singapore)</p><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2019</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Maths JeWel</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Competition</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Achievement</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Year</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>3 Honourable Mention (Junior Category)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2021</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>All Singapore Secondary Mathematics Competition for Normal Course Students</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Top Placing<br>Poh Wee Wisely (3T2)&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2021</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Singapore Kangaroo Math Competition (SKMC)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>3 Silver, 6 Bronze, 6 Honourable Mention</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2021</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Singapore Mathematical Olympiads Competition</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Honourable Mention (Senior Category)&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2020</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Singapore Kangaroo Math Competition (SKMC)&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2 Gold, 5 Silver, 6 Bronze&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2020</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Singapore Secondary Math Competition for Normal Course Students</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Third Placing<br>Poh Wee Wisely (2T2)&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2020</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Australian Mathematics Competition (AMC)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Distinction</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2019</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>JPJC Maths and Science Challenge</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Bronze</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2019</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Singapore Mathematical Olympiad&nbsp;(SMO)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Bronze</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2019&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Singapore Math Kangaroo Contest</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Gold, Silver and Bronze</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2019&nbsp;</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Science JeWel</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Competition</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Achievement</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Year</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>National Junior Biology Science Olympiad</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>1 Gold, 1 Bronze</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>2021</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ignite Competition -
