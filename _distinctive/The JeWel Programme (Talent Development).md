<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As a future-oriented and forward looking school which aims to nurture
future ready learners, thinkers and leaders, Jurong West Secondary School
is committed to providing a holistic&nbsp; education for all our students.</p>
<p>The Jurong West (JW) Experience is student-centric where we nurture and
further develop students with special talents and interests through a subject-based
Talent Development Programme (TDP), the JeWel Programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enrolment into the programme is based on a student’s talent and passion
as well as academic results in the respective subjects.</p>
<h3><strong>For Secondary One Students in JWSS IN 2025</strong></h3>
<p>Secondary One students with a&nbsp;<strong>Total&nbsp;PSLE AL Score of 14</strong>&nbsp;or

for direct admission to the TDP based on PSLE results&nbsp;<strong>still stand a chance</strong>&nbsp;to
be offered entry into the programme after their performance in the first
year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you have the passion and talent for English, Mathematics, Science,
Art or Sports, come onboard the&nbsp;JeWel Programme for an exciting journey!</p>

<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;JeWel Programme offers customised training and programmes in
four domains - Innovation, Communication, Physical and Aesthetics. Supporting
these four domains are - English Language, Mathematics, Science, Art and
Sports.</p>
<p>In English Language, Mathematics or Science, students deepen their learning
in advanced topics through focused trainings which lead to participation
in inter-school, national and international competitions as well as seminars
and conferences. In Physical Education &amp; Sports or Art, students nurture
their talent further as well as widen their horizons through exposure to
a greater variety of sports or art forms during training, events and conferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All students in the programme are mentored by teachers who guide them
to explore the subjects in greater depth and prepare them for participation
in seminars and competitions. They are also given the opportunities to
lead in school, cluster or zonal projects such as the&nbsp;JeWel Challenge
organised for the West Zone Primary Schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The programmes are designed to allow students to discover their interest
and further develop their talent so they are in good stead to pursue their
passion at the upper secondary levels by pursuing relevant ‘O’ Level subjects
such as the Pure Sciences, the Enhanced Art Programme (EAP) or Exercise
and Sports Science (ESS).</p>
<p>Through the programme, students will also be in good stead to pursue their
passion at the post-secondary levels. The&nbsp;JeWel Programme prepares
our young talents well in their chosen areas of interest and gives them
an edge when they enter a Junior College or Polytechnic at the end of Secondary
4 or Secondary 5 as they would have been developing their passion and strength
in their years in secondary school.&nbsp;</p>
