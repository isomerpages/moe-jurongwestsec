We understand that life as a student can be challenging at times and we are here to hear you out, offer you advice, guidance and suggestion on any concerns or challenges that you are currently going through.  
  

## What is our role as a School Counsellor?


![Support1.jpg](/images/Support1.jpg)

A School Counsellor is a trained professional who works in partnership with students, teachers, parents and the community to help students have a successful and positive school experience.

Our job is to help students to become responsible individuals, to be independent thinkers, to develop sound problem solving and decision making skills, and to view themselves in terms of their fullest potential.

We are committed to helping students explore their abilities, strengths, interests, and talents as these traits relate to their personal and academic development. The school’s counselling service plays an integral part of the educational process that will enable students to achieve success in school.

We have guided students with the following issues, (just to name a few):  

*   Stress related
*   Motivational related
*   Study skills
*   Family related
*   Relationship with friends/ teachers/ family members
*   Boy-Girl Relationships (BGR)
*   Cyber related
*   Bullying
*   Grief and Loss
*   Suicidal thoughts
*   Educational and/or career related

In addition, we also work very closely with the professionals at REACH WEST and if need be and with parent’s consent, we can tap on professional expertise to provide you with the necessary psychological support.
