# Special Educational Needs @ JWSS

         
**Special Educational Needs Officer (SENO)**

The SENO provides structured and critical support to students with SEN to enable them to integrate better in mainstream schools. Examples of SEN are Dyslexia, mild Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and sensory impairments. The SENO works closely with Teachers, School Leaders, and relevant School Personnel in supporting the student’s learning and / behavioural needs in school.

**Customized intervention sessions**

Based on the degree of needs (learning and / behavioural) of the students, the SENO conducts intervention sessions (after school curriculum hours), either individually and / or in small groups. During these sessions, students will be taught and equipped with strategies in areas such as social and communication skills, studying techniques, examination and organizational skills, note taking skills, problem solving skills, self-management skills and many more.

**Collaboration with various stakeholders**

Apart from working closely with the Teachers, School Leaders and relevant School Personnel, where essential, the SENO also liaises with various external stakeholders to ensure that there is continued support for the students. Examples of the external stakeholders are Parents, Psychologists / Therapists from the various agencies / organisations, namely REACH (NUH) and AWWA.
