<p>Our Overseas Student Exchange Programme (OSEP) serves to enrich and support
academic learning and Co-curricular activities by providing our students
with the opportunities to attend classes in overseas institutions and network
with overseas teachers and students. Through the exchange programme, students
will experience different school environments and gain new perspectives
in learning.</p>
<p>In line with MOEâ€™s 21st Century Competencies, JWSS OSEP, aims to provide
and nurture our students through a diverse learning environment so as to
sharpen their global awareness and cross cultural skills.</p>

<h3>Overseas Student Exchange Programme to Suzhou, China (20 - 25 October 2024)</h3>
<p>Students from JWSS had the opportunity to travel to Suzhou, China for
their yearly exchange programme this year, where we had partnerships with
3 different Chinese schools in Suzhou.</p>
<p>This year's exchange programme saw our students visiting various tech
companies in the Suzhou Industrial Park and the Volkswagan Factory in Shanghai
where they were able to have a deeper understanding of the different industries,
their challenges as well as the entrepreneurial spirit in setting up multi-national
corporations.</p>
