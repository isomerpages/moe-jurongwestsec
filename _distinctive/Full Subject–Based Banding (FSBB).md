**Purpose of Full SBB**

With Full SBB, all schools are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life.

Our school will allow Secondary 2 Normal (Technical) students in 2021 the opportunity to take Humanities subjects (Geography/History/Literature) at a more demanding level if they meet the eligibility criteria.
