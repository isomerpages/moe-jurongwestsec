<p><strong>Purpose of Full SBB</strong>
</p>
<p>With Full SBB, all schools are moving towards one secondary education,
with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs, without
labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise
the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence
and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life.</p>

<p><strong>Full SBB @ Jurong West Secondary School – Enhancing the JW Experience for our students</strong>
</p>
<p>With Full SBB, in addition to being able to offer English Language / Mathematics
/ Science / Chinese Language / Malay Language / Tamil Language, eligible
students will be able to offer the Humanities (Geography / History / Literature)
at a <strong>More Demanding Level</strong> at Secondary Two onwards.</p>
<p>As you embark on the Full SBB journey at JWSS, there will be numerous
opportunities for you to interact with peers from diverse backgrounds.
You will also be empowered with a personalized and tailored learning experience
that will allow you to explore and excel in subjects that align with your
strengths and interests. In addition, you will have more flexibility to
practise self-directedness in planning and managing your learning, especially
on Home Based Learning (HBL) days.</p>
