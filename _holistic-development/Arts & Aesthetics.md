The ampersand is one of the most flexible symbols in our alphabet. By selecting it to embody the Arts & Aesthetic approach in JWSS, the symbol promotes the unified learning culture of arts elements within the school. It seeks to encourage the school community to engage in an extensive range of arts interpretation and aesthetics freedom.

**6 July 2019: Arts Labs @ Kampung Admiralty@ The Book Room  
**  
On 6 July 2019, it was smiles all around at our Art Labs booth at Kampung Admiralty Community Plaza, as selected students from the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and the Enhanced Art Programme (EAP) took part in the Intergenerational event, as part of the Singapore Youth Festival. Our students wowed the participants by harnessing the power of ICT to engage and guide the budding artists in their creations.   
  
Through this meaningful engagement with the community and sharing of our school's art practices, our students were provided with real-life application of what they have learnt in school. It also provided an opportunity for them to acquire and practice life-skills, and build strong values and social emotional competencies through interaction with the community.
