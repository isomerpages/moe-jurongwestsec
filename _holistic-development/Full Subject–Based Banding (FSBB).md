**Purpose of Full SBB**

With Full SBB, all schools are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life.

**1\. Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2**

As part of the pilot, our school will allow Secondary 1 and 2 students the opportunity to take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level if they meet the requirements.

This is applicable to students who are in Secondary 1 Normal (Academic), Secondary 1 Normal (Technical) and 2 Normal (Academic) in 2020.

 | 

**For Secondary 1 Normal (Academic) students**

 | 

**_Eligibility_**

Students who attain an overall of 75% or higher for the specific Humanities subject in Sec 1NA in 2020 will be offered a choice to offer the specific Humanities subject at a more demanding level, that is, at the Express level, in Sec 2 in 2020.

**_Process_**

Eligible students will attend a briefing and thereafter, be issued an offer letter in which they will indicate their decision to accept or reject the offer after discussing with their parents. If the student rejects the offer, the student will continue taking Humanities at the NA level in 2020.

**_Considerations in deciding whether to take Humanities at a more demanding level_**

Taking a subject at a more demanding level would result in a heavier workload and higher assessment standards. In deciding whether to take up the offer, parents and students should consider the aptitude and interest in the specific Humanities subject, as well as the student’s ability to cope with all the other subjects.

**_Support for Students_**

Students who accept the offer will be supported via the provision of a bridging package on Student Learning Space (SLS) as well as close guidance from the respective subject teachers. Should a student be unable to cope, he/she would be advised and guided accordingly.

**2\. Organising Secondary 1 Form Classes in new ways**

 | 

**For all Secondary 1 students in 2021**

 | 

As part of the pilot, our school will implement reorganised Form Classes at Secondary 1. This is applicable to Secondary 1 students entering our school in 2021.

2021 Secondary 1 students will be grouped in mixed Form Classes, comprising students from different courses of study.

Students will attend lessons in the Form Classes only for the following subjects: Art, Design & Technology, Character and Citizenship Education, Food and Consumer Education, Music, Physical Education as well as our Applied Learning Programme (ALP).

For the academic subjects, namely English, Mother Tongue Language, Mathematics, Science, and the Humanities, students will be attending lessons based on their subject classes.  The subject classes will be organised based on their respectively courses at the NT, NA or Express levels.

The common learning experience through the mixed Form Classes provides a valuable setting for students to mingle, build meaningful friendships, and appreciate different perspectives. Whilst helping to reduce any inadvertent labelling associated with streaming.
