_‘One of the key things that we need to do is for our students to graduate with a good understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, and interests. More informed choices will reduce the attrition from school to workplace.’_ <br>

The work attachment opportunities are open to students at the upper secondary levels and typically last for one to two weeks (depending on the area of work) during the semestral holidays in June and November/December.

Students are invited to apply for the available work attachment opportunities and are selected to go on the work attachment based on certain criteria including passion for the work area and industry.

Activities in 2022
------------------

  

**ECG 2022**

As we slowly resume school activities this year, the school organised some ECG activities for students to learn and explore the different education and career pathways. Through ECG, we hope to develop students’ growth mindset and work resilience to embrace the need for lifelong learning and career adaptability. Below are some of the platforms to nurture students’ self-awareness and self-directedness to support them in discovering their strengths and interests and charting their education and career journey.

**::**&nbsp;**Talks by JWSS Alumni on their National Service Experience (2019)**  
  
In 2019, JWSS held an engagement session between JWSS alumni who were currently serving their National Service (NS) obligations. JWSS collaborated with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to invite two JWSS alumni who were serving in the SAF to share their NS experience with our Secondary 3 students, including our female students. Both our male and female students found the session meaningful and engaging, and engaged in a short question and answer segment with our alumni to learn more about the choices that they had made in NS, and the impact that their NS experience has had on their lives. We will seek to continue these engagement sessions for our students to provide them with insight on how Singapore’s defence force operates, and what they can look forward to in the future.

To enrich secondary school’s curriculum with greater diversity, secondary schools, in collaboration with polytechnics, have begun offering AEMs under the guidance of Ministry of Education (MOE). Taught by polytechnic lecturers, AEMs can help enhance the learning experience of secondary school students through practice-oriented approaches. The experience will help them to discover their strengths and interests and have a taste of how polytechnic courses are conducted.

This year, 18 of our students signed up for the AEM Aerospace Fundamentals with Flight Simulation at Singapore Polytechnic from 13 to 16 March.

It was an enriching experience for them as they learnt how to control the system and fly an aeroplane on a flight simulator, learnt about the principles of flight; how aircrafts defy gravity and fly thousands of miles above sea level, learnt about aircraft parts and related systems through hands-on at the labs and learnt about our local growing aerospace industry and career prospects.
