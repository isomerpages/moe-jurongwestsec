Every Teacher a CCE Teacher

  

This course comprised of 1.5 days of synchronous learning, complemented with asynchronous components. SDCD officers, served as chief facilitators, working with CCE Key Personnel and Specialized CCE Teachers to facilitate small group discussions with their colleagues using resources provided by SDCD. This approach is designed to provide schools with the opportunity to contextualise the learning to their student profile.
