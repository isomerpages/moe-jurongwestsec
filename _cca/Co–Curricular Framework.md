<p>To develop students into responsible, concerned and adaptable citizens
ready for life and work, JWSS focuses on the use of authentic experiences
and service to design its programs and equip students with 21 century skills,
socio-emotional skills and school values. These authentic experiences include
CCA training sessions, competitions, performances, camps, learning journeys
and overseas immersion trips. Students are also given opportunities to
use their CCA skills to lead and serve the community.</p>
<p>In JWSS, the delivery of Co-Curriculum programmes is modelled after Kolb’s
Learning Experience Cycle where experiential learning in authentic experiences
are gained through student’s service in CCA. Teacher-facilitated reflections
are conducted to help students reflect and concretise their learning. Conclusions
drawn from these discussions will be shared with other students and applied
in future context whenever possible.</p>
